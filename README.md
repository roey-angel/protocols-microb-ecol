## My personal collection of experimental protocols in microbial ecology ##

This is a collection of method protocols in microbial ecology and associated methods which I have collected/developed over the years. Each protocol states which paper should be cited. Please cite the reference which appears in the protocol and not the protocol itself or the project.

** Disclaimer **
This project as a whole and each protocol in particular are under continuous development and might therefore contain mistakes. Please report if you find any error. These protocols are intended for professional scientists with work experience in the lab. You are responsible of familiarising yourself with the precautions and proper usage instructions for each of the reagents and apparatus described in the protocols.
